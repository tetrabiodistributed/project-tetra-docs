== How to use the kanban board ==

. Assign yourself to a new or existing card or issue in the https://github.com/orgs/tetrabiodistributed/projects/1[Project Tetra - kanban board]. Consult the GitHub project admin for access, if needed.
  * Documentation related issues should be created in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs/issues[Project Tetra docs issues] and added to the https://github.com/orgs/tetrabiodistributed/projects/1[Project Tetra - kanban board].

  * Source code related issues should be created in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra/issues[Project Tetra issues] and added to the https://github.com/orgs/tetrabiodistributed/projects/1[Project Tetra - kanban board].

  * Non-documentation or source code related issues should be added as a card to the https://github.com/orgs/tetrabiodistributed/projects/1[Project Tetra - kanban board].

. Record relevant discussions in the comment section of the GitHub issues.

== Creating an issue ==

If you've found a problem in the docs, please create an issue in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs/issues[Project Tetra docs repo]. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the *Create documentation issue* button in the top right hand corner of the page.

== How to make documentation changes ==

. Create a new branch, or checkout an existing branch, in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs[Project Tetra docs repo]. The branch name should be prepended with its associated issue label followed by a `/`, followed by a `dash-separated` description of the changes to be made, followed by its associated issue number, e.g., `feature/add-tricoder-with-touchscreen-docs-1701`. If no such issue exists, <<_creating_an_issue, create a new issue>>.

. Write or update the appropriate documentation page relevant to the design changes to be made in your working branch.  All documentation should be nested under link:../../tutorials[Tutorials], link:../../how-to-guides[How-To Guides], link:../../explanations[Explanations], and/or link:../../references[References]. (See <<#_how_to_write_good_documentation, How to write good documentation>>)

. Commit your changes and create a pull request (PR). Be sure to include a closing keyword followed by the associated issue number in the PR description, e.g., `closes #1701`. If the pull request closes multiple issues, add a closing keyword for each issue. (See https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords[closing issues using keywords].

. If you're not yet ready for a review, mark the PR as _Draft_ to indicate it's a work in progress. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with the content.

. When you're ready for a review, mark the PR as _Ready for review_.

. Once your PR is merged, you may safely delete your branch.

== How to make design changes ==

Design changes include changes to CAD, STL, Drawings, or software.

. Update any relevant documentation if the design changes to be made require a change in tutorials, how-to guides, references or explanations. Update documentation before making changes to stay in line with the DDD process. (See <<_how_to_make_documentation_changes, How to make documentation changes>>)

. Create a new branch, or checkout an existing branch, in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra[Project Tetra repo]. The branch name should be prepended with its associated issue label followed by a `/`, followed by a `dash-separated` description of the changes to be made, followed by its associated issue number, e.g., `add-tricoder-with-touchscreen-1031`. If no such issue exists, create a new issue in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra/issues[Project Tetra issues].

Note: Part number revisions and version releases should accompany a design change where appropriate. (See link:../version_control/[Version Control])

. Commit your changes and create a pull request (PR). Be sure to include a closing keyword followed by the associated issue number in the PR description, e.g., `closes #1031`. If the pull request closes multiple issues, add a closing keyword for each issue. (See https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords[closing issues using keywords].
