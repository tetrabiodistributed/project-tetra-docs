== How to Contribute

We use https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] and https://asciidoctor.org/[ Asciidoctor] to format and generate our website,
the https://github.com/google/docsy[Docsy] theme for styling and site structure,
https://graphviz.org/[Graphviz] and https://plantuml.com/[plantuml] for rendering diagrams,
and https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages[GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages] to manage the deployment of the site.
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates,
content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine.
You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.
We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
Consult https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[GitHub Help] for more information on using pull requests.

== Updating the site

Here's a quick guide to updating the site:

. Fork the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs[Project Tetra docs repo] on GitHub.
. Create a new branch, or checkout an existing branch. The branch name should describe the changes to be made, followed by its associated issue number, e.g., `add-tricoder-with-touchscreen-docs-1701`. If no such issue exists, <<_creating_an_issue, create a new issue>>.
. Commit your changes and create a pull request (PR).
. If you're not yet ready for a review, mark the PR as _Draft_ to indicate it's a work in progress. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with the content.
. When you're ready for a review, mark the PR as _Ready for review_.

== Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

. Click *Edit this page* in the top right hand corner of the page.
. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click *Fork this repository and propose changes* or *Update your Fork* to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
. Follow the rest of the <<#_updating_the_site, Updating the site>> process to propose your changes.

== Running the website locally

You can run your own Hugo server using docker to preview the site locally:

. Install https://www.docker.com/[docker].
. Clone the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs[Project Tetra docs repo]. Don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs.git
cd project-tetra-docs
----
Note: If you accidentally cloned without using `--recurse-submodules`, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull down submodules needed to generate a working site.
. Run the `build.sh` script in the site root directory (Note: Linux users may need to prepend this command `sudo`). This will build a docker image, as well as install node modules, needed to locally run the `project-tetra-docs` Hugo webserver. Once the image is built and stored on your machine, you do not need to rerun this step. You can view all locally installed images by running `docker images`.
+
[source,bash]
----
./build.sh
----
. Run the `serve.sh` script in the site root directory (Note: Linux users may need to prepend this command `sudo`). By default, your site will be available at `+http://localhost:1313/project-tetra-docs+`.
+
[source,bash]
----
./serve.sh
----
. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.

== Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-docs/issues[Project Tetra docs repo]. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the *Create documentation issue* button in the top right hand corner of the page.
