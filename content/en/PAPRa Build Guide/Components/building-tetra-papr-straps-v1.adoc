== Build Steps

Once the PAPRa has been built, it should be worn.  This guide provides a simple way to put components together in an over-the-shoulder configuration.  The Fan Box has multiple attachment points, so other configurations are possible-- and please let us know if you come up with something you really like!

###  Get at least two arm lengths of webbing:

###  After cutting the webbing, burning the ends will prevent the webbing from unraveling:

###  Place one triglide in the M12 controller as shown below.  This triglide prevents the controller from sliding around on the strap:

###  Anchor the PAPR on one point near the funnel using triglides:

###  Choose another anchor point on the opposite side of the Fan Box:

###  This configuration will allow the Fan Box to be worn in the small of the back:

###  Hold a loop of the webbing out to be cut where you want clips to be attached:

###  Attach the clips as shown in this photo, with the extra triglide to make sure that the clip position can be adjusted:

And now you have a Tetra PAPRa in an over-the-shoulder configuration that can be worn comfortably for several hours!
